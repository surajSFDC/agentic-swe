 * Required artifacts for leaving state `from` (checked BEFORE the destination phase runs).

 * Semantics: the table in CLAUDE.md "Required Artifacts by State" lists what each state
 * PRODUCES.  To leave a state you must have already produced those outputs.  The `to`
 * state is only used for context-sensitive conditional checks (e.g. reflection-log.md
 * is required when re-entering `design` from `design-review`, not on first entry).
 *
 * Operating-loop step 8 ("/check artifacts") runs AFTER the phase writes its artifacts
 * but BEFORE the transition is committed, so `from` is the phase that just ran.
 *
 * @param {string} from  - the state being left
 * @param {string} _to   - the destination state (reserved for conditional checks; currently unused)
 * @param {object} state - the current work-item state object
 * @returns {string[][]} OR-groups of filenames that must exist and be non-empty
