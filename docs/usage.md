# Usage Guide

## Getting Started

No separate eval, audit, or setup steps are required. The pipeline is self-bootstrapping -- just give it a task and it handles the rest.

**Step 1: Open Claude Code in your project**

```bash
cd /path/to/your/project
claude
```

**Step 2: Start your first task**

```
/work Add retry logic to the API client
```

The pipeline automatically:
- Creates a work branch (`work/add-retry-logic`)
- Runs **feasibility analysis** (scans the repo, identifies relevant files, detects ambiguity)
- Routes to **fast path** (simple tasks) or **full path** (complex tasks)
- Implements, tests, reviews, and validates the change
- Creates a **PR** and stops for your approval

**Step 3: Respond to pipeline stops**

The pipeline pauses at these human gates:

| Stop Point | What Happened | What To Do |
|------------|---------------|------------|
| `ambiguity-wait` | The task description is unclear | Answer the questions, then `/work <id>` to resume |
| `approval-wait` | A PR has been created | Review the PR on GitHub, then `/work <id>` to resume |
| `escalate-code` | Code review failed after max retries | Review feedback in work artifacts |
| `escalate-validation` | Build/test/lint failed after retries | Check validation results |

**Step 4: Complete the work**

After you approve the PR on GitHub, resume to merge:

```
/work add-retry-logic
```

The pipeline detects your approval, merges the PR, and transitions to `completed`.

---

## Running the Full Pipeline

The `/work` command is the main entry point. It handles the entire lifecycle:

```
/work <task description>
```

The pipeline decides whether to use the **fast path** (simple, low-risk changes) or the **full path** (complex, multi-file changes with design review).

**Fast path** (typically 3-5 minutes):

```
initialized -> feasibility -> fast-path-check -> fast-implementation -> validation -> pr-created -> approval-wait -> completed
```

**Full path** (typically 10-30 minutes):

```
initialized -> feasibility -> fast-path-check -> design -> design-review -> verification -> test ->
implementation -> self-review -> code-review -> permissions -> validation -> pr-created -> approval-wait -> completed
```

To resume paused work:

```
/work <work-id>
```

## Using Specialized Subagents

135+ specialized subagents are available for domain-specific tasks. You can use them in three ways:

### Way 1: Via the `/subagent` command

```
/subagent                           # List all categories and agents
/subagent search kubernetes         # Find agents by keyword
/subagent info python-pro           # View full agent definition
/subagent invoke rust-engineer Fix the borrow checker error in src/parser.rs
```

### Way 2: Direct invocation in conversation

Just describe what you need -- Claude Code will select the right subagent:

```
Use the security-auditor subagent to audit the authentication module

Invoke the typescript-pro agent to add proper generics to the API client

Spawn the devops-engineer to optimize our Docker build
```

### Way 3: Within the pipeline

During pipeline execution, the orchestrator can automatically delegate to subagents when domain expertise is needed. For example, if the task involves Rust code, it may spawn the `rust-engineer` subagent during implementation.

## Planning Without Implementing

To analyze a task and produce a design without writing code:

```
/plan-only Add WebSocket support to the notification service
```

This runs feasibility analysis and design phases, then stops. Useful for:
- Estimating complexity before committing
- Getting a design review from the team
- Understanding what files and systems would be affected

---

## Inspecting Work Health

To check the status and health of a work item:

```
/evaluate-work <work-id>
```

This shows:
- Current pipeline state
- Budget usage (iterations remaining)
- Artifact completeness
- Any blockers or escalation risks
